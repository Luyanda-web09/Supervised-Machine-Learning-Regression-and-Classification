# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Regression-and-Classification

The theoretical foundations and practical implementation of modern machine learning (ML) algorithms. These include techniques currently used by top tech companies, giving insight into the state of the art in AI.

The course goes beyond theory — you'll pick up practical tips and tricks for improving algorithm performance and implement them yourself to better understand how they work.

Why Machine Learning Matters

ML originated as a subfield of AI aimed at creating intelligent machines.

For many tasks (e.g., speech recognition, web search, medical diagnosis, self-driving cars), it’s impractical to hand-code rules. Instead, machines learn from data.

Real-world examples include:

Google Brain: speech recognition, Google Maps, Street View.

Baidu: augmented reality, fraud detection, autonomous vehicles.

Landing AI & Stanford: applying ML in factories, agriculture, healthcare, and e-commerce.

Future of Machine Learning

ML is already deeply integrated into the software industry, but there's massive potential in other sectors like retail, transport, and manufacturing.

A McKinsey study estimates AI could add $13 trillion annually by 2030.

ML skills are in high demand, making now a great time to learn.

On Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

AGI (machines as intelligent as humans) is still far off — maybe 50 to 500+ years away.

Progress toward AGI likely depends on learning-based algorithms, possibly inspired by the human brain.

You'll hear more about this later in the course.

What is Machine Learning?

Definition:

Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed — a definition popularized by Arthur Samuel, who created a checkers-playing program in the 1950s.

His program learned by playing thousands of games against itself, improving over time without Samuel being a great player himself.

Key Insights:

The more data and experience a learning algorithm has, the better it performs.

The point of practice questions in this course is not to test you, but to help reinforce your understanding.

Types of Machine Learning:

The two main categories are:

Supervised Learning – most widely used in real-world applications; covered in depth in Courses 1 & 2.

Unsupervised Learning – covered in Course 3, along with recommender systems and reinforcement learning.

Focus of the Course:

The course emphasizes not only understanding the algorithms, but also how to apply them effectively in practical settings.

Having the right tools (algorithms) is not enough — you must also know how to use them properly.

You'll learn best practices and practical strategies to avoid wasting time on ineffective approaches, even ones used by experienced teams.

Goal:

By the end of this course, you’ll be equipped with both:

A toolbox of machine learning algorithms.

The skills and judgment needed to apply them effectively and build real-world ML systems.

Supervised Learning in Machine Learning
What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is the most widely used type of machine learning today, responsible for 99% of its economic value.

It involves learning a mapping from input x to output y using a dataset that contains both inputs and their correct outputs (labels).

The algorithm learns from examples and then predicts outputs for new, unseen inputs.

Real-World Examples of Supervised Learning:

Spam detection: Input = email, Output = spam or not spam.

Speech recognition: Input = audio, Output = text transcript.

Machine translation: Input = English sentence, Output = translation (e.g., Spanish).

Online advertising: Predicts if a user will click on an ad (input = user/ad data, output = click or not).

Self-driving cars: Input = image + sensor data, Output = object positions (like other cars).

Manufacturing: Input = product image, Output = defect or no defect (used in visual inspection).

Case Study – Predicting Housing Prices:

Input = size of a house (in square feet), Output = price.

The learning algorithm is trained on existing data (known house sizes and prices).

Once trained, it can predict the price of a new house (e.g., a 750 sq ft home).

You can use different models to fit the data: a straight line, a curve, or more complex functions.

Key Concepts and Terminology:

Supervised Learning = learning from labeled data (x → y).

Regression = predicting a continuous value (e.g., house price).

Classification = predicting a discrete category (e.g., spam vs. not spam).

The "supervised" in the name comes from the fact that the learning process is guided by correct answers during training.

Final Takeaway:

Supervised learning powers many AI systems today — from spam filters to ad targeting and quality control in manufacturing. It is foundational to building intelligent systems that learn from data and make accurate predictions.

Classification in Supervised Learning
What Is Classification?

Classification is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns to predict a category or class from a limited, finite set of possible outcomes.

Unlike regression (which predicts continuous numbers), classification predicts discrete labels, such as:

0 = benign tumor

1 = malignant tumor

Key Example: Breast Cancer Detection

Goal: Build a system to classify tumors as benign (0) or malignant (1) based on medical data.

Inputs (features) can include:

Tumor size

Patient age

Cell thickness

Uniformity of cell size/shape, etc.

The algorithm uses this input data to find a decision boundary that separates benign from malignant tumors.

How Classification Works

Learning from labeled data (x → y): The model sees examples of inputs with known labels (e.g., tumor size = 3.2 cm → malignant).

Once trained, it can predict the class (category) of new, unseen inputs.

Visual representation: You can plot the inputs (like tumor size vs. age) and see how the model separates classes using a boundary line or surface.

Types of Classification

Binary classification: Only two categories (e.g., benign vs. malignant).

Multiclass classification: More than two categories (e.g., type 1 cancer, type 2 cancer, etc.).

Categories can be:

Numeric (e.g., 0, 1, 2)

Non-numeric (e.g., cat, dog, airplane)

How It Differs from Regression
Feature	              Regression	                        Classification
Output type	          Continuous numbers	                Discrete categories
# of outputs	        Infinite possibilities	            Finite number of classes
Example	              Predict house price ($183,000)	    Predict if tumor is malignant (yes/no)

Using Multiple Inputs

Classification problems can use multiple features (inputs) to improve accuracy.

Example: tumor size + patient age → predict tumor type.

More features often lead to better performance but also require more data and processing.

Wrap-Up

Supervised learning involves learning from labeled data.

The two main types are:

Regression: Predicts continuous values.

Classification: Predicts class labels.

Classification is crucial for tasks like medical diagnosis, spam detection, image recognition, and more.

Unsupervised Learning & Clustering
What Is Unsupervised Learning?

Unlike supervised learning, which uses labeled data (input + output), unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data—only input features, no output labels.

The goal is to discover patterns, structure, or groupings in the data without being told what to look for.

Key Concept: Clustering

A major type of unsupervised learning.

The algorithm automatically groups similar data points into clusters, based on patterns it finds in the features.

It doesn’t know in advance how many or what kinds of clusters exist—it figures this out on its own.

Examples of Clustering in Real Life

1.Medical Data (Tumor Size + Age)

-No labels (e.g., benign or malignant).

-The algorithm groups patients into clusters based on similarity.

-This may reveal subgroups in the population with similar characteristics.

2.Google News Article Clustering

-Groups related news stories based on common keywords (like panda, twin, zoo).

-No human tells the algorithm what keywords to look for—it finds themes on its own.

-Enables automatic topic grouping at scale.

3.Genetic Data (DNA Microarrays)

-Rows = genes, columns = individuals.

-Colors represent how active a gene is for a person.

-The algorithm clusters people into types (e.g., Type 1, 2, 3) based on gene expression.

-Useful for discovering genetic patterns or disease subtypes.

4.Market Segmentation (Customer Data)

-Businesses group customers into segments (e.g., skill-seekers, career-builders, AI-followers).

-Helps companies tailor services or products to each group.

-Clustering helps reveal hidden customer personas without predefined labels.

Why It Matters

No labeled data is needed—ideal when labels are expensive, unavailable, or unknown.

Clustering helps reveal structure in complex datasets.

Can be used in news aggregation, genetics, customer analysis, recommendation systems, and more.

Key Takeaway

Clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning method that groups similar items together without knowing in advance what the groups should be. It’s all about letting the algorithm discover structure in the data.

More on Unsupervised Learning
Formal Definition

Supervised learning uses labeled data (inputs x + outputs y).

Unsupervised learning uses only input data x—no labels. The goal is to find patterns or structure in the data.

Types of Unsupervised Learning

1.Clustering

-Groups similar data points together automatically.

-Example: Grouping news articles or customers by similarity.

2.Anomaly Detection

-Identifies unusual or rare data points.

-Example: Detecting fraud in financial transactions.

3.Dimensionality Reduction

-Compresses large datasets into fewer dimensions while preserving essential information.

-Useful for visualization, speeding up algorithms, and removing noise.

These methods don’t require labeled outcomes, making them useful when labels are unavailable or costly to obtain.

Quiz Examples (Supervised vs Unsupervised)
Example	                                              Type of Learning
Spam Email Detection (labeled as spam/non-spam)	      Supervised
News Story Clustering (e.g., Google News)	            Unsupervised
Market Segmentation (grouping customers by behavior)  Unsupervised
Diagnosing Diabetes (labeled as diabetic or not)	    Supervised

Key Takeaways

Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns without needing labeled outputs.

Beyond clustering, anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction are also powerful tools.

You’ll explore these in more depth later in the course.

This video introduces the first machine learning model of the course: Linear Regression.

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that fits a straight line to data and is widely used in real-world applications.

Example Problem: Predicting House Prices

Goal: Predict house prices based on their sizes.

Dataset: Contains house sizes and corresponding prices from Portland, USA.

Visualized as a scatter plot (size on x-axis, price on y-axis).

A linear regression model draws a best-fit line through these data points to make predictions.

Understanding Supervised Learning

Called "supervised" because:

The training data includes inputs (x) and their correct outputs (y).

The model "learns" from these labeled examples.

The dataset is called a training set.

Regression vs. Classification

Regression: Predicts continuous values (e.g., house price like $220,000).

Linear regression is one example.

Classification: Predicts categories (e.g., cat vs. dog, or disease vs. no disease).

Only a limited number of discrete outputs.

ML Notation Introduced

x = input feature (e.g., house size)

y = target/output variable (e.g., price)

m = number of training examples

(x, y) = one training example

x^(i), y^(i) = the i-th example in the dataset

Notation like x^(1) is not exponentiation — it's indexing (refers to row 1).

To explain the process of supervised learning and introduce how models like linear regression are trained and used to make predictions.

What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning involves using a training set that contains:

Inputs (x) — e.g., size of a house.

Outputs (y) — e.g., price of a house.

The algorithm learns a function from this data to make predictions.

What Does the Learning Algorithm Do?

It learns a function (denoted as f) from the training data.

This function takes a new input x and outputs a prediction ŷ (pronounced "y-hat").

In notation:

y = actual/true output (from training set)

ŷ = predicted output (from the model)

How is the Function Represented?

For linear regression, the function is a straight line:

f(x) = wx + b


w = weight (slope)

b = bias (intercept)

This model is called univariate linear regression because it uses one input variable (uni = one).

Why a Straight Line?

Linear functions are:

Simple and easy to interpret.

A good starting point before learning more complex, nonlinear models.

Visualization

Input x is on the horizontal axis, and target y is on the vertical axis.

The model fits the best straight line through the data points to make predictions.

The implementation of linear regression, particularly the concept of a cost function.

Cost Function Definition

The cost function measures how well the linear regression model fits the training data.
It is defined as the average of the squared differences between predicted values (y hat) and actual targets (y).
Parameters of the Model

The model uses parameters w (weights) and b (bias) to define the linear function f_w, b(x) = wx + b.
These parameters can be adjusted during training to improve the model's predictions.
Visualizing the Model

Different values of w and b result in different lines on a graph, affecting the slope and y-intercept.
The goal is to choose values for w and b that minimize the cost function, indicating a better fit to the training data.

Understanding the cost function in linear regression and how it helps in finding the best parameters for a model.

Cost Function Overview

The cost function ( J ) measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values.
The goal is to minimize ( J ) by adjusting the parameters ( w ) and ( b ) to achieve a better fit to the training data.
Simplified Linear Regression Model

A simplified model is used where ( b ) is set to 0, making the function ( f_w(x) = w \cdot x ).
The cost function ( J ) is now a function of just ( w ), and the objective is to find the value of ( w ) that minimizes ( J ).
Visualizing Cost Function and Model Fit

Graphs are used to show how different values of ( w ) affect the model's predictions and the corresponding cost ( J ).
The relationship between the model fit and the cost function is illustrated, emphasizing that a lower cost indicates a better fit to the training data.

Visualizing the cost function in linear regression, enhancing understanding of how model parameters affect predictions.

Understanding the Cost Function

The cost function J(w, b) is central to linear regression, aiming to minimize the error in predictions by adjusting parameters w (weight) and b (bias).
Visualizations include a 3D surface plot representing the cost function, which resembles a bowl shape, indicating how different values of w and b affect the cost.
Visualizing with Contour Plots

Contour plots provide a 2D representation of the cost function, showing levels of equal cost values (like a topographical map).
Each contour (ellipse) represents points with the same cost, helping to identify the minimum cost point at the center of the smallest ellipse.
Next Steps

The upcoming video will explore specific choices of w and b in the linear regression model, demonstrating their impact on the fitted line to the data.

Visualizing the relationship between parameters ( w ) and ( b ) in linear regression and understanding the cost function.

Understanding Cost Function and Parameters

The graph illustrates how different values of ( w ) and ( b ) affect the cost function ( j ).
A specific example shows ( w ) as -0.15 and ( b ) as 800, resulting in a line that poorly fits the training data.
Evaluating Model Fit

The cost associated with the chosen parameters indicates how well the model fits the data; a high cost suggests a poor fit.
Another example with ( w = 0 ) and ( b = 360 ) shows a flat line, which is still not a good fit but slightly better than the previous example.
Gradient Descent Algorithm

The content introduces gradient descent as an efficient algorithm for finding optimal values of ( w ) and ( b ) to minimize the cost function.
Gradient descent is crucial for training various machine learning models, not just linear regression, and will be explored in the next video.

The concept of gradient descent, an important algorithm in machine learning used to minimize cost functions.

Understanding Gradient Descent

Gradient descent helps find the optimal values of parameters (w and b) that minimize the cost function (j).
It is applicable not only to linear regression but also to more complex models, including deep learning.
Process of Gradient Descent

Start with initial guesses for parameters, often set to zero.
Iteratively adjust parameters in the direction of steepest descent to reduce the cost function until a minimum is reached.
Local Minima in Gradient Descent

Different starting points can lead to different local minima, meaning the algorithm may converge to various solutions based on initial values.
This property highlights the importance of the starting point in the optimization process.

Implementing the gradient descent algorithm, a key concept in machine learning.

Understanding Gradient Descent

The algorithm updates the parameter ( w ) using the formula: ( w = w - \alpha \cdot \frac{d}{dw} J(w, b) ), where ( \alpha ) is the learning rate.
The learning rate ( \alpha ) controls the size of the steps taken during the optimization process, with smaller values leading to smaller steps.
Assignment Operator vs. Truth Assertion

The equal sign in programming is used as an assignment operator, meaning it assigns a value to a variable, unlike in mathematics where it asserts equality.
In programming, equality checks are often denoted by ( == ).
Simultaneous Updates in Gradient Descent

Both parameters ( w ) and ( b ) should be updated simultaneously to ensure the algorithm converges correctly.
The correct implementation involves calculating updates for both parameters before applying them, preventing interference between the updates.
Convergence of the Algorithm

The algorithm continues to update ( w ) and ( b ) until they reach a local minimum, where changes become negligible.
Understanding derivatives, which are essential for gradient descent, will be covered in the next video, but prior calculus knowledge is not required.

Understanding the gradient descent algorithm, which is essential for optimizing machine learning models.

Gradient Descent Overview

The learning rate (Alpha) determines the size of the steps taken to update model parameters (w and b).
The derivative term (d over dw) is crucial for understanding how changes in parameters affect the cost function.
Intuition Behind Gradient Descent

When minimizing a cost function with one parameter (w), the update rule is w = w - Alpha * (dJ/dw).
The slope of the tangent line at a point on the cost function indicates whether to increase or decrease w to minimize the cost.
Examples of Gradient Descent

Starting at a point where the derivative is positive leads to a decrease in w, moving left on the graph and reducing the cost.
Conversely, starting at a point with a negative derivative results in an increase in w, moving right and also reducing the cost.

The importance of the learning rate in the gradient descent algorithm, which is crucial for optimizing machine learning models.

Understanding Learning Rate

The learning rate (alpha) significantly affects the efficiency of gradient descent. A poorly chosen learning rate can lead to ineffective optimization.
If the learning rate is too small, the algorithm converges to the minimum very slowly, requiring many iterations to make progress.
Effects of Learning Rate

A small learning rate results in tiny updates, leading to slow convergence towards the minimum.
Conversely, a large learning rate can cause the algorithm to overshoot the minimum, potentially leading to divergence and failure to converge.
Local Minima and Gradient Descent

If the parameter is already at a local minimum, further updates will not change its value, as the derivative at that point is zero.
As gradient descent approaches a local minimum, the steps taken become smaller due to the decreasing derivative, allowing for more precise convergence.

Implementing the squared error cost function for linear regression using gradient descent.

Linear Regression Model and Cost Function

The squared error cost function is used to train the linear regression model to fit a straight line to the training data.
Derivatives of the cost function with respect to the parameters (weights and bias) are calculated to implement gradient descent.
Gradient Descent Algorithm

The algorithm updates the weights and bias simultaneously until convergence, using the derived formulas for the derivatives.
It is important to choose an appropriate learning rate to ensure convergence to the global minimum.
Convex Functions and Local Minima

The squared error cost function is a convex function, meaning it has a single global minimum and no local minima.
This property ensures that gradient descent will always converge to the global minimum when applied to this cost function.

The implementation of gradient descent for linear regression.

Gradient Descent Overview

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in linear regression.
The process involves iteratively updating parameters (w and b) to reduce the cost, leading to a better fit of the model to the data.
Batch Gradient Descent

Batch gradient descent uses the entire training dataset to compute the gradient at each update step.
This method ensures that the model parameters converge towards the global minimum of the cost function.
Practical Application

Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions, such as estimating house prices based on size.
The content also introduces optional labs and quizzes to reinforce understanding and implementation of gradient descent in coding.
